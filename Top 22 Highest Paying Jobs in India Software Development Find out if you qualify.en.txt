Hello and Welcome to Musings by Amit
Today
I am going to talk about
twenty two
highest paying jobs
for software engineers
This topic
is interesting
because salaries
of 80% software engineers
have remained average
or below average
in the last ten years
Now
the software industry is changing
and if you focus on
the right streams of software development
then chances are
that you can increase your salary
by two times
or even four times
within a short time
So in this video
we are going to discuss
Why
you should focus
on high paying jobs in software
What
are the streams of software development
where
you can get these High Paying Jobs
What
is the competition
for these kind of jobs
And most important thing
How do you prepare yourself
to get these high paying jobs
You will find all the answers
in this video
so stay till the end
And if you want to become
a top earning software engineer
wherever you are in the world
then pay full attention
But before we move forward
I want you to like this video

Having done that
Let us start with
why
do you need to focus on
getting the Highest Paying Jobs
in the Software Industry
I will tell you why
I have a friend
who is a software engineer
I know him since 2006
At that time
he was a fresher
and he got
a below average salary
as a fresher in software development
Do you know
the average salary of a fresher
in the software industry?
In India
it is Rupees three lacs twenty five thousand
per annum
whereas
in the US
it is dollars sixty seven thousand five hundred
the sad part is
that this average salary
has remained the same
for last ten to fifteen years
Ask any software engineer
Coming back to my friend
I met him after ten years
in 2016
he was frustrated
and the reason was
his low paying job in a software company
he was with the company
for more than ten years
he told
Amit, I am struggling with my finances
my salary is poor
it is peanuts compared to my colleagues
with the same experience
I am not able to find another job
or improve my income
and now
the company is talking about layoffs
it is very disturbing
I don’t know what to do
And
this video is inspired by that conversation
I am going to tell you exactly
what I told him
and this information
changed his salary
during our conversation
I understood
that he was working on the same things
that he had learned in 2006
Over that
he was doing
the same type of software projects
Now you are smart
and you don't need to be Albert Einstein
to say
If you keep doing the same things
then you keep getting the same results
If you remain on the same technology
for an extended period of time
then your income
will grow very slowly
this is an attitude
of a mediocre software engineer
and I don’t want you to have this attitude
I want you to be that software engineer
who sees
how the industry is shaping up
with respect to technology
and is at the forefront of that technology
because
such an engineer will never have to worry
about salary or promotions or even layoffs
That is the single biggest reason
you as a software engineer
should focus on getting
the highest paying jobs
in the software industry
because when you do that
you will get ideas and insights
about streams of software development
you need to focus on
otherwise
if you are remain frustrated
then like my friend
you will be left behind earning peanuts
If there is only one thing
you can take from this video
then take this
focus all your attention
on skills that will get you a high paying
job
so that you will become invincible
in the software industry
and this is a mindset change more than
learning a new skill
And I was able to increase my salary
by thirty two times in eight years
because of this mindset change
Every two years I got a salary raise
and one time I got a raise
within 9 months of starting at a job
just by focusing
on the latest streams in software development
at that time
If you are convinced
let us look at
streams of software development
where you can get high paying jobs
Recently I was reading a newsletter from Infosys
In that Infosys mentioned
twenty two
different streams of software development
where they are looking for power programmers
prower programmers
are the best engineers in Infosys
they command a higher salary
than the regular programmers
In the same way last year
TCS announced double salary
for specific software engineers
they call Hot Talent
even other software services companies
like IBM, Wipro, Accenture, Capegemini, Cognizant,
Tech Mahindra
or product companies like
Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook
or SaaS companies like Amazon, Paypal, Salesforce
have made such an announcement
So after doing a detailed research
I found that
there are twenty two streams of software development
where companies are ready to pay a much higher
salary
often two times to four times more than average
salary
at all levels
And this is not just in India
This is across the world
Software Industry in US, UK, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand,
European Union, Russia, China
and many other countries

Focusing on any one
of these twenty two streams
will give you an opportunity
for a high paying job
Now, what is the competition
So in 2018
about two hundred thousand
software engineers
applied to TCS for a job as a fresher
They took the
popular National Qualifier Test of TCS
also known as the Ninja Test
From these thirty six thousand engineers
got selected for a job in TCS
But out of that thirty six thousand engineers
there were two thousand engineers
who were given a double salary
Because these engineers
had the knowledge of
one of the streams
we have mentioned here for highest paying
jobs
So 5.55% freshers were given a double salary
If you see other services companies
like Infosys, Capegemini, Cognizant,
Accenture, Wipro
then you will see a similar trend
of 5% engineers getting a double salary
But the product companies
like Microsoft, Salesforce, Google, Facebook,
Amazon, Paytm
and many others
are hiring engineers
in these streams for a long time now
almost for a decade
they hire more engineers
in these streams than services companies
So overall
20% of all software engineers
can take advantage of these streams
of software development
and this percentage will
keep increasing with time
So to get these high paying jobs
You have to be within top 20 software engineers
out of hundred
That is the real competition
It is not easy
but if you are determined
and you really want to succeed
in the field of software development
then you have to work toward
upgrading your skills
to one of the streams of software development
discussed in this video
So coming to the last question
how do you do this,
how do you position yourself
to get this high paying jobs
The first thing is
decide one of the streams
of software development you like
then go online
and find out
what are the jobs available in that stream
pay attention to the job description
and see what companies looking for
in engineers related to that field
then you can do an appropriate certification
or specialisation in that stream
If you want I have a document
link is in the description
you can download this document
where I have listed some certification or
specialisation
related to the streams of software development
mentioned here
This is to help you
understand
what you need in order to find jobs in that
field
Also I will be making a video
on each stream I have mentioned here
In that I will cover
Why that stream is gaining popularity?
What type of projects are happening in that
stream?
Which global companies are hiring for that
stream?
What are the skills companies want in you?
And
How you can upgrade yourself
to become better in that stream?
Once you get the basic knowledge
of working in a certain stream
then you can immediately apply for
an internship or a job in that field
once you get a job you are on your road to
success
you will be able to quickly
increase your income
by two times or even four times
your existing salary
And for all those
experienced software engineers
who are getting an average salary
watch this video where I explain
how you can go from an average salary
to two to three times your salary
in two appraisal cycles
